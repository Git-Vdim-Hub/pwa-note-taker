## Description
When it comes to technology, redundancy is key to success! One way to accomplish redundancy is by using a progressive web application framework with a local storage option such as indexedDB.
- My biggest motivation for this project was getting the opportunity to work with webpack, service workers, and indexedDB! 
- Having the ability to install an app without a an app store/market is truely great!
- The app allows individuals to take notes and save those notes!
- During the development of this app I learned how to use Service Workers, Webpack, Babel, and integrating all of it with express while using a folder structure with multiple package.json files. Finally I spent some time writing deployment scripts and storing data into localStorage IndexedDb
